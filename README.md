Questions:

1. Is it good to implement "transitional variables" f.ex. 'array_string' (FooBar.js, ln: 3-9), which I commented later and thus got rid of one more variable.

2. Do I always need 'if (err) throw err;' as an argument for fs.writeFile/fs.readFileSync? I've tried to go without it but it always gived me an error.

Thanks! <3
